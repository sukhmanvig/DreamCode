        <h1>Learn about Stacks</h1>
        <br><br><br>
        <div id="explanationDiv">
            <p>
                A Stack is a data structure that is frequently used in computer science, it 
                is commonly described as a <i>Last in, First out</i> data structure.
            </p>
            <p>
                Stacks can be used to store data, and <i>LIFO</i> refers to that the data in the stack can only be accessed in the reverse order it was added in. A helpful way to think about stacks is to compare them to how a pack of 3 tennis balls works. The container is cylindrical and just wide enough to fit a tennis ball. Only the top most tennis ball can be accessed and it is also the most recently added. Thus, the top most tennis ball is the <strong>"last one in"</strong> and must be the <strong>"first one out"</strong>, just like in the image below.
            </p>
            <img src="./imgs/tennis_balls.png" width="100px" height="150px"/> 
            <p>
                It can also be helpful to think of the items of a stack organized vertically, with the top of the stack representing the last item added. There are 2 main methods to interact with stacks.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> <strong>Push</strong> - Adds something to the top of the stack.</li>
                <li> <strong>Pop</strong> - Removes something from the top of the stack.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>



            <h4>How to play the stacks game:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The goal of the game below is to make the Output box match the Goal box.
                    Both are listed on the right side of the Game window.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <strong>Current item</strong> will show the item that was most recently popped from a Stack.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The buttons labeled with <strong>Push</strong> will put the current
                    selection into the button's labaled destination. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <strong>New Game</strong> button will reload the game with a fresh set
                    of input circles.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <strong>Push</strong> and <strong>Pop</strong> buttons to manipulated the stacks can be found below the game window.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stack numbering starts from 0.
                </li>
            </ul>
