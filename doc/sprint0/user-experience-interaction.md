Notes:
* Above is an interactive wireframe outlining the key interactions and website navigation flow.

* Use the mouse scrollwheel to scroll on the prototype.
To access the full website, click "Start Learning" or "Sign In" on the Landing page. 
Then click "Sign In" in the box with Username and Password. (No need to type)

* Click anywhere on the prototype to show clickable elements.

* To see an overview of all the available pages, click "DreamTeam" in the top left.
Note that duplicate pages are just part of an animation (this how it works in Adobe XD).
