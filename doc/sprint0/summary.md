Project Objective:

The objective of the project is making coding and coding practices easier to understand and more welcoming to everyone regardless of prior knowledge to encourage more people to learn to code irrespective of their age or their experience in the field. We intend to provide a learning resource that introduces complex topics to a beginner programmer through means of a graphical representation in games. Some of these topics can include data structures like arrays, stacks, and trees. As well as algorithms like sorting, maximum flow, shortest path or as simple as following syntax rules, variable declaration, if conditions, and looping.
 
The Key Personas:

Anjali Metha is an 8-year-old girl that is full of energy, bubbly and loving. Anjali loves playing online games related to princesses, sports, and colourful cartoons. She is very naturally curious about how things work and does very well in her STEM related classes because of how creative she is with her solutions and loves to critically think/problem solve. She sees her older siblings coding all the time and aspires to be like them but is told she is too young. She has a short attention span, so she struggles paying attention for long and often drops what she is doing for whatever comes into her mind.

Scott Manjang is a 16-year-old black teenager that works part-time after school to purchase things he wants including video games and new smart technology that he plays within his room. He is very competitive and hates to lose, and he likes to learn new things, but he hates reading books. He is a quick visual learner that uses his creativity to think of solutions to problems then trying those out to see if they work. He wants to learn how to code in hopes of creating his own video game or software that he can design and develop however he wants. He has tried to learn coding on his own but because of all the technical reading he never fully understood the concepts. He is interested in taking Computer science in university because he thinks computer science is about problem-solving and he would be able to finally learn to code.
 
The Key Scenarios:
    
Anjali’s parents want her to learn something outside of school and fuel her natural curiosity but can’t take her to extracurriculars because of their busy work life and she often loses interest so they sign her up for Codeland which gamifies the learning process and creates colourful and interactive lessons in easy-to-swallow chunks to ensure Anjali won’t lose interest.
    
Ahmad Khan wants to learn how to code but is overwhelmed on where to start and gets discouraged to try. He feels wherever he starts, he finds something else that seems to be more important and flip flops between starting at certain languages, or data structures, or algorithms. Signing up to Codeland can give that sense of structure and progression in his learning that Ahmad needs to feel like he’s improving and give him the confidence that he is learning in an optimal way.
    
Scott Manjang understands what he wants but struggles to find a way of learning that fits his visual learning style. Codeland provides plenty of visual depictions of many coding-related concepts that fits right with his visual learning style so he can learn concepts that he previously had trouble with such as data structures which will help lead Scott into the game developer future that he wishes to pursue.

Key Principles:    

We want first and foremost to make sure levels provide a strong fundamental base and show what and where our users can learn more and the applicability of their new knowledge. We also want to make our users have an easy and intuitive experience navigating and using our site. This might reduce our system efficiency and is heavier in terms of server load but will be worth creating a more complete product that can help people even after completing our levels.
