# Team Organization
There will be seven members of the Dream Team. Each of them will specialize on one of the subjects.

We held frequent meetings to discuss the project. Although we had two main competing ideas, one being the covidtracker and the other a documentation-exploring programming game, we settled on the game as the project. We might work on the covidtracker as a side project.

Organization tools used: 
* Personal discord group
* CSC301 Piazza teammate thread
* CSC301 Discord
* Straw Poll
* Microsoft Outlook Calendar sharing
* Google Drive and Docs
* Zoom meetings

How we organized our team:
* Discussed team formation on CSC301 Piazza teammate thread.
* Created a Discord group to hold project meetings.
* Used the #looking-for-group text channel on 301 Discord to recruit new members.

Deciding project ideas:
* Brainstormed project ideas in project meetings.
* Met every day of the week to discuss project ideas.
* Attended Prof’s office hours on Zoom to discuss the potential of our project ideas. All three seems candid, though “competition” may be of interest.
* Decided project idea through a Straw Poll vote. Result: The game.
* Working through sprint0 deliverables
* Scheduled a group meeting to distribute sprint0 deliverables among group members.
* Created a Google Doc to brainstorm ideas for sprint0 deliverables.

Prioritizing user stories:
* Our user stories consider multiple demographics and accommodate people of any level of programming background.
* We sorted the user story by importance and then complexity. We want this application to be as informative, such that it catches the interest of all levels of programmers.
* The Discord group (i.e. Other ways we worked together)
* Created a #ideas and #reminders text channel to record project ideas and set meeting reminders.
* Used a Microsoft Outlook Calendar sharing to schedule and keep track of project meetings.
* Created a #meeting-summaries channel to record brief summaries of past meetings for members who miss a meeting. 
* Created a #notes-resources text channel to store and pin important project documents (e.g. Github repo link, Jira server link, Google Doc for sprint0)

Lessons for next phase:
* More structured meetings.
* Create meeting previews that describe the layout of the meeting 
  * What topics/issues will be discussed during the meeting 
  * What tasks are expected to be done and by who
  * Meeting duration (How long the meeting will last)
* Create a separate text channel on Discord for meeting previews
  * Potential issues and problems with our implementation and how we settled arguments.
* Not really a lesson, but we should use Jira to track and manage sprint tasks going forward.
