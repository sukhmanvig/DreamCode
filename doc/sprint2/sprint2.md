# Sprint 2 Planning

**Meeting Documented:** Yes, 7/7 members of the Dream Team attended and contributed to the meeting on our discord server.

## Goal
Our goal for sprint 2 was to implement new features on the website we developed in sprint 1. To achieve this goal, we are completing user stories to implement the following:

* Add new games to the website.
* Write a game code template to help build future games.
* Account login features.
* A "Contact Us" page so users can provide feedback.
* A "User Profile" page where user stats and information can be viewed.

We are covering the following user stories for sprint 2:

* As a Python Learner, I want to edit and run Python code snippets, so that I can try things out for myself in Python.
* As a visual learner, I want to interact graphically with how stacks work, so that I can learn the concept in a visual way.
* As a learner, I want to read about stacks, so that I can learn about them.
* As an unregistered user, I want to create an account that will save my progress between sessions.
* As a user who forgot their password, I want to be able to reset my password with my email, so that I can sign in again.
* As a new Python Programmer, I want to try solving Python problems, so that I can practice my understanding.
* As a Python Learner, I want to view my profile which shows my levels, experience, and badges.
* As a visual learner, I want to interact graphically with how Python if-statements work, so that I can learn the concept in a visual way.
* As a learner, I want to read about if-statements, so that I can learn about them.

Accomplishing this goal will further develop the features of our website and more learning topics for our users to explore.

## Spike

Our spike for this sprint is to learn how to integrate the account management features with a back-end database. We are deploying on the Heroku web platform so part of this sprint is to get our website properly communicating with the database Heroku hosts. Additionally we will be administering the tables and configuration of the database.
