# Sprint 2 Retrospective Meeting

## Meeting is documented

- Yes, meeting was held in our discord chat where members of the Dream Team conducted the Sprint 2 retrospective meeting.

## Unfinished tasks from sprint 2

Tasks from sprint 2 that need to be completed in sprint 3:

- The DREAM-63 (Quest Template) needs to be updated in future sprints and needs to be made functional once the account functionality has been implemented.
- The DREAM-83 (Save progress) task was not completed in this sprint which is a part of the DREAM-14 (Add Account Creation functionality and save user progress) user story.
- We were not able to complete the task of DREAM-86 (Change the password on the backend) for the DREAM-16 (Add Ability for User to Reset Password) user story. We were not able to complete this because the account creation task was not completed which is DREAM-14

## Practices to continue for next sprint

We will continue to have daily meetings, regularly scheduled standups, communicate with all team members and update everyone on the progress of the project. We will also work on individual tasks, help our teammates when needed and work on the sprint we are assigned daily.

We will continue assigning tasks early in the sprint to keep the momentum of development moving forward. We will also continue organizing the tasks such that members are not duplicating work when implementing their deliverables.

## New practices to consider for next sprint

We will consider integrating the new features earlier in the sprint to help mitigate the impact of unexpected issues that can appear when incorporating new code to the existing project.

## Harmful practices to avoid for next sprint

This sprint we overestimated our capacity to implement new features, it was a busy week and we could've accounted better for our other responsibilities and the time they would take.

We also underestimated the time it would take to troubleshoot some of the issues we faced while developing in new langauges. Moving forward we will also account for the time it can take to troubleshoot errors that arise while learning.

We did not really coordinate when we would have collaborative problem solving sessions, group meetings served as as both broad progress updates and troubleshooting times, but this was not strictly scheduled. If we scheduled specific collaborative sessions, we could better track our timeline and adjust for solving these individual issues.

## Best experience

Seeing the new web pages and games come to life on the website, which is now hosted on Heroku.

## Worst experience

Learning about JavaScript’s “pass by reference” and debugging when it silently fails.
