# Sprint 1 Planning

**Meeting Documented:** Yes, 7/7 members of the team attended.

## Goal
The goal for Sprint 1 is to develop the overall website framework, and implement 1 game to introduce a learning topic of the platform. To achieve this goal we are completing user stories to implement the following:

* Homepage
* Dashboard page
* About page
* Settings page
* A “Hello World” game

In particular, we are completing the following user stories in this sprint:

* As a curious user, I would like to read about the developers, so that I could check out any other work they've done.
* As a new user, I want to access a landing page, so that I can start navigating the app.
* As a new user, I want to have access to a settings page, so I can configure what the app allows me to change.
* As a User, I would like to have a dashboard where the games are listed, so that I can see which games are available to be played.
* As a User, I want a basic introduction to programming, so that I can get started.

Accomplishing this goal will give us a structured base for each of our game ideas and features to attach to.

## Spike

Our spike for this sprint is that the team’s members need some time to get familiar with javascript and Vue. So in addition to developing the basic website pages, the team will be exploring Javascript and Vue in Sprint 1 so we can begin full game development in Sprint 2. We have chosen this as a spike because the team has other workloads over the Sprint 1 time period, and we felt there is not enough capacity to accommodate our more complicated features.
