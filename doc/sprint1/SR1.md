# Sprint 1 Retrospective Meeting

## Participants in the meeting

- Akeem Brisco, Jazelle Diaz, Jayvin Chang, Komal Kaler, Sukhman Vig, Arnaud Michel, Hao Mack Yang

## Unfinished tasks from sprint 1

We completed all tasks. There are no unfinished tasks for sprint 1.

## Practices to continue for next sprint

We will continue to have daily meetings, regularly scheduled standups, communicate with all team members and update everyone on the progress of the project. We will also work on individual tasks, help our teammates when needed and work on the sprint we are assigned daily.

## New practices to consider for next sprint

For the next sprint we want to consider assigning tasks to individuals early in the sprint so that team members do not have overlapping parts. We want to test our code earlier and more frequently in order to send progress reports to teammates. 

## Harmful practices to avoid for next sprint

- We managed our time well for this sprint however we still need to manage our time better within our daily team meetings. We hope to do this by setting and following a schedule for our daily meetings so that the meeting schedule is time stamped. This is so we know when to move on to talking about the next task/topic for our sprint. An example of this schedule will look like the following:

  * Meeting Schedule for Feb 12th, 2021
     * 6:00-6:30 - finish off sprint 1 docs, upload to github 
     * 6:30-7:00 - sprint 1 retrospective.

- We need to stop the practice of not properly updating group members about the amount of progress we made the day before. We will improve this by giving mini demos and sharing our screens for often to show group members what we have completed.
- To avoid merging conflicts we will try to do a mini release a few days before the due date, so integrating things will be easier.

## Best experience

Seeing all the cool stuff the team developed was exciting. Found it satisfying to see our website coming together.

## Worst experience

Time  wasted and spent on debugging.
