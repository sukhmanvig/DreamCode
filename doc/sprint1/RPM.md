# Release Planning Meeting Document

**Meeting is documented:** Yes, every member of the Dream Team attended and contributed to the meeting on our discord server.

## Major Release Goal

We aim to deliver a website that teaches computer science concepts. The main learning topics include stacks/queues, arrays/dictionaries, and if-logic. The end product will teach these concepts in visual ways using games to represent the underlying computer science ideas based on the uase stories listed.

In developing the project, we are prioritizing the features involving the games and providing learning topics. We will also provide a convenient, customizable, an easy-to-understand user interface as noted on the user stories.

## Release Plan

The release plan for the application is to develop 1 or 2 major features per sprint regarding the learning topics of the website. We will also be adding features to improve the user experience on the site.

Our release plan incrementally develops the following epics:

* Users can practice various computer science topics by playing games that represent the underlying data structures and algorithms.
* Users can customize the appearance of their dashboard page, see their gameplay statistics, and track their own and other's progress on leaderboards by creating an account.

## Sprint Goals

An overview of possible sprint goals is outlined below.

* Sprint 1 - Implement core website UI and introductory game.
* Sprint 2 - Implement learning topic for stacks and queues data structure. Implement learning topic for arrays and dictionaries.
* Sprint 3 - Implement learning topic for if-logic, add educational code snippets for all learning categories.
* Sprint 4 - Implement account functions and supporting auxilary features.

## Completion Date

Project is expected to be completed and released by April 2, 2021.

During the release planning meeting the following things
are established:
• Major release goals
• Release plan
• Potential sprint goals
• Completion date
---
• As each sprint progresses the burndown of story points
measure the velocity of work, which can be used to
determine progress and adapt the plan as we go
Other things we need (from rubric):

Major Release Goals: Build a website that teaches some computer science concepts (stacks, queues, arrays, dictionaries, if-logic), teach these concepts through games. 
Release plan: incrementally add features through sprints, 1-2 major features for a Sprint.
Potential sprint goals: learning topic for a sprint, 1 sprint can be stacks/queues, 1 sprint for if-statements, 1 sprint for account management and cusotmization features, etc.
Completion date: April 9, 2021 (releasing product on Apr 3, 2021)
---
Release goals: implement a learning topic per sprint / or improve a learning topic with new features.
Reference to user stories - all stories that mention teaching topics in a graphical way.
---
Release Goals: Primary Features are the learning topics and learning games.
Sprint1: Basic UI
Sprint2: Games
Sprint3: Games
Sprint4: Account functionality
Reference to User Stories: All stories that are about learning topics.
Not including: Account Stories, Settings, About Page, etc. as part of references for now.
NOTE: Ideas listed are contributions from ALL members of this meeting.

Sprint 1: Create a basic website with a landing page
Try React or Node JS?
HTML and CSS
! Mack Mulligan !02/04/2021
For releasing updates, I would say, add a "news section"
And modify-add nodes which represent level  level progress, profile progress

Feedback form for bug reporting

Final Release Goal: For the website using one general CSS external style sheet, for now (to make everything look the same). Look into accessibility potentially to make the website  more user friendly. Going to host on Github pages, and move it to something else later.
Jæzie | Jazelle02/04/2021
Major Release Goals - Have a functional project built, with most important user stories implemented, such as having the game webpage from the wireframe built, with sufficient amount of working games (including topics in Arnaud's post above)
Release plan: decide user stories priority for each sprint, what part of the project to complete for each sprint, implement and complete user stories by the end of each sprint, take time to review the state of the project at each stage, discuss any issues and consider improving on areas
Completion date: best 1 week before April 9, 2021 which is the presentation day for time to prepare
komal02/04/2021
Create one of our games in sprint1 (can be barebones) to see and assess how comfortable we are with the tech so we can design and create other games accordingly
Akeem02/04/2021
for the website we will start to create the basic page for sprint 1 with HTML and reacts, using the one CSS sheet for all the main page. use the user story to to implement some of the features need. Use Git for now to host the server until we can host it our-self
Jayvin02/04/2021
User stories for release: 
Add Main Website Page
Create visual game for dictionaries
Create visual game for arrays
Create game for stacks
Create visual game teaching if-statements
Add Menu For Topic Navigation
Create visual game for queues
Add code snippets showing if-statement use
Add code snippets showing dictionary use
Add code snippets showing array use
Add code snippets showing queue use
Add code snippets showing stack use
