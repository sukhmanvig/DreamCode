# Sprint 3 Retrospective Meeting

## Meeting is documented

- Yes, meeting was held in our discord chat where members of the Dream Team conducted the Sprint 3 retrospective meeting.

## Unfinished tasks from sprint 2

Tasks from sprint 3 that are being moved to sprint 4:

- [DREAM-90] Create a quest map
- [DREAM-88] Website saves and updates sessions when completing quests
- [DREAM-25] User can save their progress mid-game

These tasks are being moved to sprint 4 because they depend on some backend functionality that was implemented in this sprint.

## Practices to continue for next sprint

We will continue to have daily meetings, regular standups, and maintain open communication on members' progress. We will also keep assigning tasks such that they can be done by a single developer, avoid duplicating work, and provide support to members when they require it.

Planning the sprint tasks early has worked well in the last 3 sprints, so we will continue to have the planning meeting early in the sprint so we can keep organized moving in to sprint 4.

## New practices to consider for next sprint

We will consider integrating all of our feature branches sooner in sprint 4. This is dependent on how much development time is required to implement the new features.

## Harmful practices to avoid for next sprint

We again overestimated our capacity to complete all the user stories, converting plain HTML+Javascript to React components has been a more involved task than anticipated and slowed development during the sprint.

We also underestimated the time it would take to troubleshoot some issues we would encounter. Moving forward we will also account for the time it can take to troubleshoot errors that arise while learning.

Collaborative time was better managed in sprint 3, but it still occurred during regular group meetings, we will try to improve scheduling this to better optimize how the team can help each other out.

## Best experience

Seeing the frontend-backend functionality of the account features start to work.

## Worst experience

Troubleshooting Heroku with React and Html pages in the same folder, This is causing some errors.
