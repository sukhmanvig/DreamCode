# Sprint 3 Planning

**Meeting Documented:** 7/7 members of the Dream Team contributed to the meeting on our discord server.

## Goal

The goal for sprint 3 is to finish implementing user account functionality, improve the featureset of the existing if-statement and stack games, and add a new game to represent Arrays.

We intend to implement the following for sprint 3:

* Add account creation
* Add leaderboard
* Add ability to reset password
* Add Python learning content
* Add account authorization functionality
* Add remember progress functionality
* Add code snippets for the if-statement and stack games
* Add a new game for Array data structures
* Improve website navigation

These features are represented by the below user stories:

* As an unregistered user, I want to create an account that will save my progress between sessions.
* As a logged in user, I want to see my score on a leaderboard, so that I can see how others are doing in the games.
* As a user who forgot their password, I want to be able to reset my password with my email, so that I can sign in again.
* As a user I would like to be able to edit and write my biography on the profile page.
* As a previously logged in user, I want the game to remember my account ID, so that I donâ€™t have to sign in each time I open the app.
* As a logged in user, I want the game to remember my progress, so that I don't have to redo everything each time I use the app.
* As a Python Learner, I want to see Python examples of stacks, so that I can start using them in my own code.
* As a signed in user, I want to be able to change my login password, so that I can change my login credentials.
* As a visual learner, I want to interact graphically with how Python lists work, so that I can learn the concept in a visual way.
* add the navigation functionality to end able users to navigate to different HTML and react pages throughout the app

## Spike

There is no Spike for sprint 3, all efforts for sprint 3 are going towards implementing features from the product backlog.
