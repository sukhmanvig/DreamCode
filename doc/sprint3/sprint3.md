# Sprint 3 Planning

**Meeting Documented:** 7/7 members of the Dream Team contributed to the meeting on our discord server.

## Goal

The goal for sprint 3 is to implement features so the user can create an account, view their account information, and change their account password. Additionally, we will implement at 1 new game for the website.

Sprint 3 will implement the following:

* A game teaching users about Python lists
* Account registration and login
* Account password modification and reset
* A biography section for the user in the profile page
* Code snippets showing if-statement and stack use
* Information about Python learning resources and links to them
* Public leaderboard for users to view their scores


These features are represented by the below user stories:

* [DREAM-14] As an unregistered user, I want to create an account that will save my progress between sessions.
* [DREAM-30] As a signed in user, I want to be able to change my login password, so that I can change my login credentials.
* [DREAM-36] As a visual learner, I want to interact graphically with how Python lists work, so that I can learn the concept in a visual way.
* [DREAM-18] As a logged in user, I want to see my score on a leaderboard, so that I can see how others are doing in the games.
* [DREAM-16] As a user who forgot their password, I want to be able to reset my password with my email, so that I can sign in again.
* [DREAM-20] As a new Python Programmer, I want to read about basic Python syntax.
* [DREAM-91] As a user I would like to be able to edit and write my biography on the profile page.
* [DREAM-19] As a Python Learner, I want to see Python examples of stacks, so that I can start using them in my own code.
* [DREAM-29] As a Python Learner, I want to see working Python examples of if-statements, so that I can start using them in my own code.

## Spike

Potential challenges for this sprint:

* Turning existing HTML pages into React components
* Figuring out how to link our React components (webpages) together
