# Sprint 4 Retrospective Meeting

## Meeting is documented

- The meeting was held in our discord chat where members of the Dream Team conducted the Sprint 4 retrospective meeting.

## Unfinished tasks from sprint 4

User stories that were not completed this sprint:

- [DREAM-25] Add Ability to save progress midgame and have a continue option on re-entry

There wasn't enough time to implement this story among other features, but it represents a non-critical function of the website so we chose to prioritize other user stories.

## Good practices from this sprint

We continued to hold daily meetings, this kept all members of the team up to date on progress for sprint 4. Daily meetings also provided a channel to raise any issues we encountered during the sprint.

At the end of sprint 3, we planned out the tasks for sprint 4. This planning helped organize our workflow for the 2 weeks and allowed us to easily gauge whether we were on track.

## Harmful practices from this sprint

We wanted to implement a lot of user stories in sprint 4 since this was the last sprint. By planning for a large volume of user stories, this slightly overestimated what our real velocity would be. To mitigate this, we focussed on the most important user stories that contribute to the minimum viable product.

## Best experience

Seeing the website come together as a React app, many html pages were converted to React components in this sprint.
