# Sprint4.md

**Meeting Documented**: Yes 7/7 Team Members Attended. 

## Goal

React-ify our current website (i.e. Convert all existing HTML pages into
collections of React components and link them together). Create a
dictionary, queue, sorting , and tree-traversal game. Implement SSO
(single sign-on) for user accounts. Implement daily coding challenges
for registered users. 

### New Features

* A collection of games teaching users about Python dictionaries,
  queues, sorting algorithms, and tree traversal

* Code snippets showing dictionary, queue, sorting algorithm, and tree
  traversal use 

* Users who request SSO, will be logged in automatically upon visiting
  our website

* Registered users can attempt daily coding challenges

### User Stories

The following user stories will be completed in **sprint4**:

* **\[DREAM-5\]** As a learner, I want to have daily challenges, so
  that I can learn something everyday.

* **\[DREAM-23\]** As a Python Learner, I want to see Python examples
  of queues, so that I see how to use them in my own code.

* **\[DREAM-26\]** As a learner, I want to read about queues, so that
  I can learn about them.

* **\[DREAM-31\]** As a learner, I want to read about dictionaries, so
  that I can learn about them.

* **\[DREAM-32\]** As a previously logged in user, I want the game to
  remember my account ID, so that I don’t have to sign in each time I
    open the app.

* **\[DREAM-35\]** As a visual learner, I want to interact graphically
  with how queues work, so that I can learn the concept in a visual
  way.

* **\[DREAM-37\]** As a visual learner, I want to interact graphically
  with how dictionaries work, so that I can learn the concept in a
  visual way.

* **\[DREAM-89\]** As a signed in user, I want to get my progress
  saved to the back end upon completion.

* **\[DREAM-128\]** As a learner, I want to read about tree traversal,
  so that I can learn about them.

* **\[DREAM-130\]** As a visual learner, I want to interact
  graphically with tree traversal, so that I can learn the concept in
  a visual way.

* **\[DREAM-135\]** As a User, I want to understand how to efficiently
  sort items in a data structure.

## Spikes

* Linking our React components together using **React Router**

<!-- -->

* Dealing with overlapping CSS styles on the web application. The use
  of Bootstrap site-wide will result in unexpected styling appearing
  on each of our pages
